# The Lair - Complete Storyline

## Prologue: The Quest Begins

In a world where magic is written in code and power is measured in logic, there stands the grand citadel of learning known as **Cebu Institute of Technology University**. To the outside world, it is a school, but to those who walk its halls, it is a proving ground for the next generation of digital pioneers.

A new student arrives, fresh from high school, ready to master the arcane arts of Information Technology and earn a degree. But this is no ordinary education. The path to graduation is a legendary quest—a series of five great trials, each overseen by a formidable instructor who guards their knowledge with skill and wisdom.

To succeed, one must journey through realms of programming, conquer challenges of data, and command the very foundations of technology. The greatest tests lie not in simple exams, but in battles of wit and creativity against the masters themselves.

**The first trial awaits. The quest for knowledge begins now.**

## Stage 1: NGE 101 – The Hall of Ma'am Cathy

### The Trial of Fundamentals

You enter the first chamber. Torches roar to life, painting the walls in fiery light. The air burns with heat. At the far end stands **Ma'am Cathy**, her gaze sharp and unwavering.

**MA'AM CATHY (calling out):**
> "You dare to begin the trials? Then prove you can withstand the fire. Defeat my students first — only then may you face me."

From the flames, minions rise—five Goblins, each testing your basic combat skills. As you defeat them, random events may occur: story moments that grant insight, environmental hazards that drain your Wisdom, or unexpected encounters with code entities like Syntax Errors and Null Pointers.

**The Puzzle Sequence:**
Before facing Ma'am Cathy directly, you must prove your knowledge of the fundamentals—Loops and Conditionals. You face 3-5 puzzles covering:
- For loops, while loops, do-while loops
- If-else statements and conditional logic
- Loop execution guarantees
- Valid loop structures in Java

**The Boss Battle:**
The last ember fades. Ma'am Cathy steps forward, staff glowing like molten steel.

**MA'AM CATHY:**
> "You've survived the sparks, but I am the true flame. Let us see if your resolve burns brighter than mine."

In battle, when Ma'am Cathy's HP drops to 40% or below, she may challenge you with up to 3 finisher puzzles. Answer correctly to deal extra damage, or watch her regenerate if you fail.

**Boss Epilogue:**
Ma'am Cathy lowers her staff, the fire around you dimming. She studies you with a firm but approving look.

**MA'AM CATHY:**
> "You did not falter. Good. You've proven your resolve burns bright. Carry this spark with you — you will need it for what lies ahead."

*The flames part, revealing the path to the next chamber.*

## Stage 2: NGE 102 – The OOP Sentinel of Sir Khai

### The Trial of Order

The next chamber is cold and still. Marble floors stretch into perfect patterns, and glowing runes hover in neat rows. At the center waits **Sir Khai**, arms crossed, expression stern.

**SIR KHAI:**
> "Strength without discipline is chaos. If you wish to face me, first show that you can withstand the guardians of order."

The runes split apart and form five Sorcerers—more powerful than the previous goblins, each testing your growing strength. Random events continue to shape your journey, with story moments revealing secrets about the guardians' weaknesses.

**The Puzzle Sequence:**
Before facing Sir Khai, you must prove your knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming:
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Class relationships and design principles
- OOP fundamentals in Java

**The Boss Battle:**
When the last sentinel falls, Sir Khai uncrosses his arms, summoning a great blade etched with symbols.

**SIR KHAI:**
> "You endured the rules, but can you wield them? I will test your grasp of structure itself. Stand ready."

Sir Khai is a formidable opponent with 900 HP, testing your ability to maintain order in chaos. His finisher puzzles challenge your understanding of OOP principles.

**Boss Epilogue:**
Sir Khai lowers his great blade, its glow fading. He nods once, his stern gaze softening slightly.

**SIR KHAI:**
> "You've shown discipline. Chaos did not claim you, and you bent structure to your will. Take this lesson forward. Only with order can true strength be built."

*The marble floors realign, forming a staircase to the next hall.*

## Stage 3: NGE 103 – The DSA Sentinel of Sir Serato

### The Trial of Flow

You step into a chamber filled with shifting pathways and streams of light that twist like rivers. The ground itself seems to reconfigure with every step. At the far bank of a glowing stream, **Sir Serato** watches calmly.

**SIR SERATO:**
> "Algorithms are not about strength, but efficiency. Waste a step, and you fail. To face me, first survive my flowing constructs."

The streams ripple and release five Thieves—agile enemies that test your tactical thinking. Environmental hazards become more dangerous, requiring careful Wisdom management.

**The Puzzle Sequence:**
Before facing Sir Serato, you must prove your knowledge of Debugging and Data Structures:
- Binary search algorithms
- Stack and queue operations
- Sorting algorithms
- Exception handling (NullPointerException, etc.)

**The Boss Battle:**
When the last phantom collapses, the streams converge. Sir Serato steps across the glowing current, staff transforming into a blade of light.

**SIR SERATO:**
> "You've seen the flow. Now you must master it. Let us test your ability to find the optimal path."

Sir Serato's 850 HP and 140 Logic make him a challenging opponent, testing your ability to find efficient solutions under pressure.

**Boss Epilogue:**
Sir Serato's blade of light dissolves back into streams, which calm into gentle rivers. He inclines his head with respect.

**SIR SERATO:**
> "You found your way through the flow without waste. That is the mark of mastery. Remember — the shortest path is not always the easiest, but it is the truest."

*The glowing streams gather, forming a bridge to the next chamber.*

## Stage 4: NGE 104 – The Database of Ma'am Tulin

### The Trial of Structures

The next chamber stretches into an endless library. Shelves twist into mazes, ladders rearrange themselves, and scrolls knot into webs. At the far balcony stands **Ma'am Tulin**, her staff glowing with threads of data.

**MA'AM TULIN:**
> "Data without form is chaos. To build is to choose the right structure. But before you face me, prove you can survive among them."

The shelves shift, releasing five Dire Wolves—powerful enemies with 80 HP each, testing your endurance and strategic planning. Random encounters become more frequent, offering both danger and opportunity.

**The Puzzle Sequence:**
Before facing Ma'am Tulin, you must prove your knowledge of Information Systems:
- Database normalization
- SQL queries and operations
- Primary keys and relationships
- ACID properties

**The Boss Battle:**
The last structure collapses, and the library grows still. Ma'am Tulin descends, her staff now a lattice of interwoven branches glowing with light.

**MA'AM TULIN:**
> "You've walked among stacks, queues, trees, and graphs… but can you command them in battle? Let me see the architect in you."

With 950 HP, Ma'am Tulin is the most durable guardian yet, testing your ability to manage resources and maintain structure under pressure.

**Boss Epilogue:**
Ma'am Tulin's lattice-staff folds back into a scroll. The shelves stop twisting, falling into peaceful order.

**MA'AM TULIN:**
> "You held the structures together. You commanded them, instead of being lost among them. With this, you are prepared for the final judgement — but be warned, it will call upon all that you have learned."

*The library doors creak open, revealing the golden staircase upward.*

## Stage 5: NGE 105 – The Dean's Office

### The Final Trial

The final staircase rises into a vast chamber of steel and stone. The hum of servers fills the air, glowing nodes and circuits lining the walls. At the center stands **The Dean**, calm yet commanding.

**THE DEAN:**
> "You have kindled flame, forged order, mastered flow, and embraced structures. But these are fragments. The true test is harmony — bringing all together. If you would stand before me, prove first you can endure the echoes of every trial."

Unlike previous stages, Stage 5 begins directly with a puzzle sequence—the most challenging yet, covering all topics from previous stages. This is your final test of comprehensive knowledge.

**The Puzzle Sequence:**
Before facing The Dean, you must prove your mastery of ALL subjects:
- Design patterns
- Exception handling
- REST APIs
- Java collections
- All previous topics combined

**The Boss Battle:**
When you prove your knowledge, The Dean steps forward, the chamber stabilizing, lights focusing on her.

**THE DEAN:**
> "You have endured each piece… but can you weave them whole? This is not a test of knowledge alone, but of mastery. Now — face your final judgement."

The Dean is the ultimate challenge:
- **Phase 1**: 1200 HP, 170 Logic, 450 Wisdom
- **Phase 2** (at 30% HP): Transforms, Logic increases to 180
- **Special Abilities**: Can channel powers from all previous guardians
- **Finisher Puzzles**: Up to 3 when weakened, covering all subjects

**Final Boss Epilogue:**
The echoes of the masters fade into light, their trials complete. The storm inside the chamber stills, and silence settles over the great hall.

The Dean lowers her hand, her gaze steady and voice firm.

**THE DEAN:**
> "You have faced every master — flame, order, flow, and structure — and you triumphed even when they rose again. You have proven that you are not merely a learner, but one who embodies all that we teach."

She steps closer, holding out a radiant seal. Its glow burns with the strength of every trial you conquered.

**THE DEAN:**
> "From this moment, you are no longer an initiate. You are a Scholar — one who carries both knowledge and mastery. Walk forward, and let the world see what you have become."

*The gates open behind her, golden light pouring through. You take your first step into the world beyond, the mark of a true Scholar upon you.*
