## The Lair

In a world where magic is written in code and power is measured in logic, there stands the grand citadel of learning known as the **Cebu Institute of Technology University.**

To the outside world, it is a school, but to those who walk its halls, it is a proving ground for the next generation of digital pioneers.

A new student arrives, fresh from high school, ready to master the arcane arts of Information Technology and earn a degree. But this is no ordinary education. The path to graduation is a legendary quest—a journey through seven great trials. Each trial is overseen by a formidable instructor, guardians of knowledge who test only the worthy.

To succeed, one must journey through realms of programming, conquer challenges of data, and command the very foundations of technology itself.

The greatest tests lie not in simple exams, but in battles of wit and creativity against the masters.

The first trial awaits. The quest for knowledge begins now.....

## CHOOSE CHARACTER

<b>Stage 1 – The Hall of Flame (Ma’am Cathy)</b><br>

You enter the first chamber. Torches roar to life, painting the walls in fiery light. The air burns with heat.
At the far end stands *Ma’am Cathy,* her gaze sharp and unwavering.

<b>MA’AM CATHY (calling out):</b><br>
“You dare to begin the trials? Then prove you can withstand the fire. Defeat my students first — only then may you face me.”

<b>From the flames, minions rise:</b><br>
<b>(start minion fight)</b><br>
<b>(when all minion defeated)</b><br>

The last ember fades. Ma’am Cathy steps forward, staff glowing like molten steel.

<b>MA’AM CATHY:</b><br>
“You’ve survived the sparks, but I am the true flame. Let us see if your resolve burns brighter than mine.”

<b>(Boss fight begins.)</b><br>
<b>(Boss defeated)</b><br>
Boss Epilogue:
Ma’am Cathy lowers her staff, the fire around you dimming. She studies you with a firm but approving look.

<b>MA’AM CATHY:</b><br>
“You did not falter. Good. You’ve proven your resolve burns bright. Carry this spark with you — you will need it for what lies ahead.”

<i>The flames part, revealing the path to the next chamber.</i>

========================================================================<br>
<b>Stage 2 – The Hall of Order (Sir Khai)</b><br>

The next chamber is cold and still. Marble floors stretch into perfect patterns, and glowing runes hover in neat rows.

At the center waits Sir Khai, arms crossed, expression stern.

<b>SIR KHAI</b><br>
“Strength without discipline is chaos. If you wish to face me, first show that you can withstand the guardians of order.”

The runes split apart and form minions:
<b>(minion fight)</b><br>

<b>(all minions defeated)</b><br>
When the last sentinel falls, Sir Khai uncrosses his arms, summoning a great blade etched with symbols.


<b>SIR KHAI</b><br>
“You endured the rules, but can you wield them? I will test your grasp of structure itself. Stand ready.”

<b>(Boss fights begins)</b><br>

<b>(Boss defeated)</b><br>
Boss Epilogue:<br>
Sir Khai lowers his great blade, its glow fading. He nods once, his stern gaze softening slightly.

<b>SIR KHAI:</b><br>
“You’ve shown discipline. Chaos did not claim you, and you bent structure to your will. Take this lesson forward. Only with order can true strength be built.”

<i>The marble floors realign, forming a staircase to the next hall.</i>

========================================================================<br>
<b>Stage 3 – The Buglord Compiler(Sir Serato)</b><br>

You step into a chamber filled with shifting pathways and streams of light that twist like rivers. The ground itself seems to reconfigure with every step.

At the far bank of a glowing stream, Sir Serato watches calmly.

<b>SIR SERATO</b><br>
“Algorithms are not about strength, but efficiency. Waste a step, and you fail. To face me, first survive my flowing constructs.”

The streams ripple and release minions:
<b>(minions fight</b><br>

<b>(all minions defeated)</b><br>
When the last phantom collapses, the streams converge. Sir Serato steps across the glowing current, staff transforming into a blade of light.

<b>SIR SERATO</b><br>
“You’ve seen the flow. Now you must master it. Let us test your ability to find the optimal path.”

<b>(Boss fights begins)</b><br>

<b>(Boss defeated)</b><br>
Boss Epilogue:<br>
Sir Serato’s blade of light dissolves back into streams, which calm into gentle rivers. He inclines his head with respect.

<b>SIR SERATO</b><br>
“You found your way through the flow without waste. That is the mark of mastery. Remember — the shortest path is not always the easiest, but it is the truest.”

<i>The glowing streams gather, forming a bridge to the next chamber.</i>

========================================================================<br>
<b>Stage 4 – The Chamber of Structures (Ma’am Tulin)</b><br>

The next chamber stretches into an endless library. Shelves twist into mazes, ladders rearrange themselves, and scrolls knot into webs.

At the far balcony stands Ma’am Tulin, her staff glowing with threads of data.

<b>MA'AM TULIN</b><br>
“Data without form is chaos. To build is to choose the right structure. But before you face me, prove you can survive among them.”

The shelves shift, releasing minions:
<b>(minions fight)</b><br>

<b>(minions defeated)</b><br>
The last structure collapses, and the library grows still. Ma’am Tulin descends, her staff now a lattice of interwoven branches glowing with light.

<b>MA'AM TULIN</b><br>
“You’ve walked among stacks, queues, trees, and graphs… but can you command them in battle? Let me see the architect in you.”

<b>(Boss Fight Begins)</b><br>

<b>(Boss Defeated)</b><br>
Boss Epilogue:<br>
Ma’am Tulin’s lattice-staff folds back into a scroll. The shelves stop twisting, falling into peaceful order.

<b>MA'AM TULIN</b><br>
“You held the structures together. You commanded them, instead of being lost among them. With this, you are prepared for the final judgement — but be warned, it will call upon all that you have learned.”

<i>The library doors creak open, revealing the golden staircase upward.</i>

========================================================================<br>
<b>Stage 5 – The Dean’s Judgement (Ma’am Dean)</b><br>
The final staircase rises into a vast chamber of steel and stone. The hum of servers fills the air, glowing nodes and circuits lining the walls.

At the center stands Ma’am Dean, calm yet commanding.

<b>MA'AM DEAN</b><br>
“You have kindled flame, forged order, mastered flow, and embraced structures. But these are fragments. The true test is harmony — bringing all together. If you would stand before me, prove first you can endure the echoes of every trial.”

She raises her hand, and suddenly the chamber trembles. All the defeated bosses reappear — Ma’am Cathy, Sir Khai, Sir Serato, and Ma’am Tulin — their strength diminished, their vitality halved from their previous defeat, yet still formidable.<br>
<b>(summon previous boss)</b><br>

<b>(all previous boss defeated)</b><br>
When the last echo fades does Ma’am Dean step forward, the chamber stabilizing, lights focusing on her.

<b>MA'AM DEAN</b><br>
“You have endured each piece… but can you weave them whole? This is not a test of knowledge alone, but of mastery. Now — face your final judgement.”

<b>(Final boss fight)</b><br>

<b>(after boss fight)</b><br>
Final Boss Epilogue:<br>
The echoes of the masters fade into light, their trials complete. The storm inside the chamber stills, and silence settles over the great hall.

Ma’am Dean lowers her hand, her gaze steady and voice firm.

<b>MA’AM DEAN:</b><br>
“You have faced every master — flame, order, flow, and structure — and you triumphed even when they rose again. You have proven that you are not merely a learner, but one who embodies all that we teach.”

She steps closer, holding out a radiant seal. Its glow burns with the strength of every trial you conquered.

<b>MA’AM DEAN:</b><br>
“From this moment, you are no longer an initiate. You are a Scholar — one who carries both knowledge and mastery. Walk forward, and let the world see what you have become.”

<i>The gates open behind her, golden light pouring through. You take your first step into the world beyond, the mark of a true Scholar upon you.</i>
