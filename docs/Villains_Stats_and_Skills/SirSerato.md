##Sir Serato — *The Algorithmic Tyrant*

*(Architect of Logical Collapse)*

**HP:** 700<br>
**Logic (Attack Power):** 500<br>
**Wisdom (Mana):** 350

##Role in The Lair

***Second Trial Guardian** — A master of data structures gone rogue. Once a wise compiler spirit, Serato grew obsessed with optimization — now he twists logic trees, tangles graphs, and fragments arrays into chaos. Players face him to prove mastery over structure, recursion, and complexity itself.
***Theme:** Data Structure Corruption — linked lists that bite back, trees that loop into infinity, and graphs that trap explorers in cycles.
***Battle Style:** Algorithmic traps and structure manipulation; the longer the battle runs, the more complex it becomes.

##Skills

***Recursive Reaper**
***Cost:** 50 Wisdom
***Effect:** Deals Logic × 1.0 (500 base) damage for 3 turns.
***Mechanic:** Each repetition doubles in cost unless “base case” is found.
***Puzzle Twist:** Player must identify the recursion’s base condition (like spotting the stop case in a function) or risk infinite recursion damage.
***Cooldown:** 4 turns.

----<br>

***Stack Overflow**
***Cost:** 60 Wisdom
***Effect:** Instantly deals Logic × 0.95 (475 base) and overloads the player’s stack.
***Debuff:** Player cannot queue multiple skills next turn — all future actions must “pop” correctly or misfire.
***Puzzle Twist:** Player must choose correct “order of operations” to clear the stack safely.
***Cooldown:** 3 turns.

---<br>

***Heap Corruption**
***Cost:** 80 Wisdom
***Effect:** Spreads a data corruption status, causing 50 HP loss per turn until “heap cleaned.”
***Puzzle Twist:** Player must manage limited memory allocation by freeing nodes in the right order — failure triggers a Memory Leak Explosion.
***Cooldown:** 5 turns.

---<br>

***Binary Search Slash**
***Cost:** 40 Wisdom
***Effect:** Logic × 0.8 (400 base) precision strike that doubles in damage if the player’s HP is in the “midpoint range.”
***Puzzle Twist:** If the player’s HP divides evenly by 2, damage is critical — Serato “finds the target in log₂ time.”
***Cooldown:** 2 turns.

---<br>

***Graph Trap (Ultimate)**
***Cost:** 120 Wisdom
***Effect:** Encloses the player in a recursive graph of false exits — 150 damage per turn until cycle is detected.
***Puzzle Twist:** Player must trace the correct path through a maze of “nodes” (logic questions or quick tasks). Wrong paths loop back, wasting turns.
***Cooldown:** 6 turns.

###Battle Flow
*Opens with Binary Search Slash to test the player’s defensive logic.
*Follows up with Stack Overflow to limit actions and enforce turn order thinking.
*Mid-fight, launches Recursive Reaper — forcing players to think like recursive functions.
*When pressured, taints memory with Heap Corruption, creating chaos in resource management.
8Final phase: summons the Graph Trap, turning the battle into a maze of decisions.
